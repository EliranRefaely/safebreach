Hi,<br>
<br>
Attached is my solution for the assignment. There are definitely aspects I could have built more robustly, but in this exercise, I wanted to showcase my abilities. <br> 
It's important to note that I have knowledge in HTML and CSS, as well as Typescript, but I preferred to use Streamlit in Python because itâ€™s much easier and faster. Moreover, as Alina mentioned in the interview, there is no need to focus on the UI, but rather on the backend.

In order to execute the on your machine, please download the repository install streamlit <br>
In the folder you just donwloaded open a terminal and write the command - `streamlit run ./app.py`
