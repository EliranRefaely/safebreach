Hi,<br>
<br>
Attached is my solution for the assignment. There are definitely aspects I could have built more robustly, but in this exercise, I wanted to showcase my abilities. <br> 
It's important to note that I have knowledge in HTML and CSS, as well as Typescript, but I preferred to use Streamlit in Python because itâ€™s much easier and faster. Moreover, as Alina mentioned in the interview, there is no need to focus on the UI, but rather on the backend.

You can use the link I created here - https://safebreach-6b47a66363a2.herokuapp.com/

In order to execute the on your machine, please download the repository install streamlit <br>
In the folder you just donwloaded open a terminal and write the command - `streamlit run ./app.py`
